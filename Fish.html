      <div class="about-header">
        <h4 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction</h4>
        <p>The idea that fish have a 3 second memory is a widely believed myth, often used to explain why fish seem to forget their surroundings. However, scientific research has debunked this myth, showing that fish are capable of learning and remembering things. 
        </p>

    <div class="about-header2">
      <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Origin</h1>
      <p>The origin of the 3 second memory myth likely started from a misunderstanding of fish behavior. Observers noticed fish repeating certain actions, such as swimming into the glass of an aquarium, and assumed this was due to bad memory. Additionally, characters such as Dory in Finding Nemo, who suffers from short term memory loss has made it common among children. Over time, this misconception became widely accepted, even though there is no evidence supporting it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-header3">
    <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Research</h1>
    <p>Studies have shown that fish have much longer memory than the myth suggests. For example, goldfish can remember tasks and environments for months. In one study, goldfish were trained to navigate a maze and still remembered the correct path weeks later. African cichlids have been shown to recognize and remember individual tank mates, even after being separated for long periods. Salmon remembers the scent of their home and use this memory to go back to their birthplace for spawning, even after years since leaving. Archerfish can learn to recognize human faces and remember them for long periods of time. These studies show that fish are capable of good memory and learning, making them far more intelligent than what the myth depicts.
    </p>

<div class="about-header4">
  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Myth Persistance</h1>
  <p> Despite the scientific evidence, the myth that fish have a 3 second memory still persists. First, fish often repeat certain behaviors, which can be mistaken for forgetfulness. This behavior is likely due to curiosity, or stress. Making jokes about other animals being stupid and forgetful, makes us feel better as well as reinforces the myth. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="about-header5">
  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Conclusion</h1>
  <p>The idea of fish having a 3 second memory has been debunked by numerous studies. Fish are capable of learning and have decent memory. Understanding these fish better can help us appreciate their intelligence and also encourage better treatment for these animals, whether in tanks or in nature.
