        <h4 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction</h4>
        <p>For decades now, many parents swear that sugar causes their kid to be hyperactive, seeing that their kids run around and scream after eating candy. While there is some correlation between sugar and hyperactive kids, correlation does not mean causation. Research has shown that sugar has no effect on a kid being hyperactive.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-header2">
      <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Origin</h1>
      <p>The origin of the myth is largely attributed to Benjamin Feingold’s book Feingold Diet. The book recommends a sweetener, food colouring, artificial flavouring and a salicylate (a chemical found in plants)-free diet to treat hyperactivity. The diet didn’t specifically claim that eliminating sugar will help with hyperactivity. However, it did alert parents about food additives being able to cause hyperactivity. With sugar being associated with those additives parents start seeing their kids become more hyper after ingesting sugar. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-header3">
    <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Research</h1>
    <p>In 1994, a double-blinded controlled trial was conducted on a group of children who were supposedly sensitive to sugar to see if a diet that was high in sucrose (sugar) or aspartame (an artificial sweetener) had an effect on a child’s behaviour and cognitive functions. At that time, sucrose and aspartame were both reported to cause hyperactivity in children. Double-blinded controlled trials are considered the gold standard of clinical trials as both the researchers and the participants don’t know who’s getting a placebo until the study is over to eliminate any biases. </p>
    <p>The participants and their families followed a different diet for 3 consecutive 3-week periods. One diet was high in sucrose with no artificial sweeteners, another diet was low in sucrose and used aspartame as the sweetener, and the third diet was low in sucrose and used saccharin (placebo) as the sweetener. All of the diets were free of preservatives, food additives, and food colouring. During these 9 weeks, the parents assessed the child’s behaviour. At the end of the test, both the results of the cognitive and behavioural test and the results reported by the parents showed that neither sucrose nor aspartame caused discernible behavioural effects.</p>
