        <h4 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction</h4>
        <p>Many believe that warm water is better than cold water when you are sick. This idea has been passed down through generations, with warm fluids often recommended for sore throats, congestion, and digestion. While some see it as folklore, science supports that warm water offers real benefits during illness.

    <div class="about-header2">
      <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Origin</h1>
      <p>The belief in warm water's benefits comes from traditional medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine promotes internal warmth for healing, while Ayurveda supports warm water for digestion and detoxification. Western medicine has long recommended warm fluids like tea and broth for soothing symptoms. These traditions have reinforced the idea that warm water is beneficial when sick.</p>

  <div class="about-header3">
    <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Research</h1>
    <p>Warm water soothes a sore throat by relaxing muscles and improving blood circulation. It helps with nasal congestion by loosening mucus and makes breathing easier. Warm water also aids digestion, reducing bloating and discomfort. Hydration is key during illness, and warm water encourages better fluid intake. Improved blood circulation from warm water allows oxygen and nutrients to reach affected areas faster, supporting recovery. Cold water can make mucus thicker, worsening congestion and making it harder to clear airways. It can tighten throat muscles, increasing irritation. Cold water may also slow digestion, causing bloating and discomfort. Additionally, drinking cold water can lower body temperature slightly, making it harder to maintain warmth needed for fighting infections.</p>
    <p>Studies confirm the benefits of warm water. Research has found that warm beverages provide quick relief from sore throats, runny noses, and coughs. Studies also show that warm water helps clear congestion by increasing mucus flow. Health professionals recommend warm water with honey or tea for soothing symptoms and improving hydration. These findings support the idea that warm water is more effective than cold water when sick.</p>

<div class="about-header4">
  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Scientific evidence and traditional wisdom both confirm that warm water is better when you are sick. It soothes the throat, clears congestion, supports digestion, and keeps the body hydrated. While cold water isnâ€™t necessarily harmful, it can worsen symptoms and slow recovery. Choosing warm water over cold water is a simple yet effective way to feel better faster.</p>
