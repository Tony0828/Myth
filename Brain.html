        <h4 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction</h4>
        <p>The myth that we only use 10% of our brain has existed for decades 
            The myth is still widely believed in today, appearing in books and 
            science fiction movies. According to a survey conducted in 2013, around
             65% of Americans believed in the myth. With more advancements in neuroscience better common sense this myth is easily disproven.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-header2">
      <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Origin</h1>
      <p>While we don’t know exactly how it started. We largely attribute this 
        myth to a misinterpretation of the book “The Energies of Men” published 
        by Harvard psychologist William James back in 1907, where he suggested 
         that humans use only a fraction of their mental potential, though 
         he never specified a percentage. The work of psychologist Boris 
         Sidis and his prodigious son, William James Sidis, further fueled
          fascination with untapped human potential, though they also never
           cited a 10% figure. It was also falsely attributed to Albert Einstein, lending it unwarranted credibility. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-header3">
    <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Research</h1>
    <p>Modern science has thoroughly debunked the 10% brain myth. advancements
         in neuroscience, particularly through technologies like MRI and PET scans, 
         allow us to observe brain activity in real time. These scans have shown 
         that almost all parts of the brain are active at different times, even 
         during rest or simple tasks. If we truly used only 10%
           of our brain, injuries to specific regions would rarely affect us.
            However, even minor brain injuries, such as concussions or strokes, 
            can have significant impacts on memory, thinking, and physical abilities,
             demonstrating that much more of the brain is involved in daily activities. </p>

    <p>The brain multiple backup areas that can handle similar
         tasks. These features make the brain adaptable and resilient, helping it
           recover from injuries. This proves that
           the brain is fully active and efficient, with all parts playing 
           a role. From an evolutionary and common sense standpoint, it wouldn’t make sense 
           for the brain to use 20% of the body’s energy, if 90% of it was unused. This clearly 
           disproves the 10% brain myth, showing that the entire brain 
           is actively involved in keeping us functioning.</p>

<div class="about-header4">
  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Myth Persistance</h1>
  <p>The myth spread through several ways, making it difficult to eradicate. Self-help books and motivational speakers were primary sources, promoting the idea that people could achieve extraordinary success or abilities by tapping into the "unused" portions of their brains. Books often used the myth as a marketing tool, promising readers that they could unlock hidden potential and become smarter, more creative, or more successful.
    The claim that Albert Einstein endorsed the myth further fueled its spread. Since Einstein is regarded as one of the smartest men, people assumed that if he believed in the idea, it must be true, even though there is no evidence Einstein ever said anything implying that he believed in it.
    </p>
    <p>Movies and TV shows also played a significant role in popularizing the myth. Films like Lucy depict characters gaining superhuman abilities by accessing more of their brainpower, embedding the idea in popular culture. These dramatic portrayals made the myth more believable and known to the general public, even though they were purely fictional.
        Additionally, the myth persists because it aligns with human psychology. The idea that we have untapped potential is deeply appealing, offering hope that we can achieve more with minimal effort. This psychological appeal, combined with the influence of media and misinformation, has allowed the myth to endure despite overwhelming scientific evidence against it. The rise of the internet and social media has also helped spread the myth, as it is often shared as a "fun fact" without verification.

  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>The myth that humans only use 10% of their brains has been thoroughly debunked by modern neuroscience. Advances in brain imaging technologies, studies of brain injuries, and an understanding of the brain’s energy consumption all confirm that virtually every part of the brain is active and essential. While the idea of unlocking hidden potential is enticing, the reality is that the brain is already a highly efficient and fully utilized organ. </p>
