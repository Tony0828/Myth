        <h4 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction</h4>
        <p>Many people know that we stop growing once we are an adult, but not that we actually start to shrink as we get older. This can be noticed in older individuals. This is not a trick, it’s proven that we shrink. From grandparents who seem a little shorter than they used to be to friends who swear they’ve lost an inch or two, height loss is a common as we get older. But why does this happen? Is it just a natural part of getting older, or are there ways to slow it down? Science shows that shrinking with age is real, and understanding the reasons behind it can help us take better care of our bodies as we grow older.

    <div class="about-header2">
      <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Origin</h1>
      <p>The observation that people shrink as they age has been noticed for centuries, being attributed to wearing down the body over time. Historically, this was the idea of shrinking in old age. Over time, as our scientific understanding of human body and aging improved, researchers identified specific factors contributing to height loss, such as spinal disc compression and bone density changes. </p>

    <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Research</h1>
    <p>Research has consistently shown that height loss is a part of aging. Studies indicate that people can lose between 1 to 3 inches as they grow older, starting at around their 30s. One of the reasons for this is the compression of the spinal discs. The discs between the vertebrae in the spine act as cushions, and over time, they lose fluid and become thinner, leading to a reduction in height. Another factor is osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones. It can cause the vertebrae to collapse or become compressed. Research published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research found that women tend to lose more height than men, likely due to a higher risk of osteoporosis. Changes in posture, muscle loss, and the damage to the joints also affects ones height.</p>

  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Conclusion</h1>
  <p>The idea that people shrink as they age is true and supported by scientific evidence. Spinal disc compression, osteoporosis, and changes in posture contributes to this. While some height loss is unavoidable, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as including regular exercise and a balanced diet, can help minimize its effects. Understanding this can help use reduce its effect and come to terms with it.
