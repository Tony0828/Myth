        <h4 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction</h4>
        <p>For decades now, many parents swear that sugar causes their kid to be hyperactive, seeing that their kids run around and scream after eating candy. While there is some correlation between sugar and hyperactive kids, correlation does not mean causation. Research has shown that sugar has no effect on a kid being hyperactive.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-header2">
      <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Origin</h1>
      <p>The origin of the myth is largely attributed to Benjamin Feingold’s book Feingold Diet. The book recommends a sweetener, food colouring, artificial flavouring and a salicylate (a chemical found in plants)-free diet to treat hyperactivity. The diet didn’t specifically claim that eliminating sugar will help with hyperactivity. However, it did alert parents about food additives being able to cause hyperactivity. With sugar being associated with those additives parents start seeing their kids become more hyper after ingesting sugar. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-header3">
    <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Research</h1>
    <p>In 1994, a double-blinded controlled trial was conducted on a group of children who were supposedly sensitive to sugar to see if a diet that was high in sucrose (sugar) or aspartame (an artificial sweetener) had an effect on a child’s behaviour and cognitive functions. At that time, sucrose and aspartame were both reported to cause hyperactivity in children. Double-blinded controlled trials are considered the gold standard of clinical trials as both the researchers and the participants don’t know who’s getting a placebo until the study is over to eliminate any biases. </p>
    <p>The participants and their families followed a different diet for 3 consecutive 3-week periods. One diet was high in sucrose with no artificial sweeteners, another diet was low in sucrose and used aspartame as the sweetener, and the third diet was low in sucrose and used saccharin (placebo) as the sweetener. All of the diets were free of preservatives, food additives, and food colouring. During these 9 weeks, the parents assessed the child’s behaviour. At the end of the test, both the results of the cognitive and behavioural test and the results reported by the parents showed that neither sucrose nor aspartame caused discernible behavioural effects.</p>

<div class="about-header4">
  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Myth Persistance</h1>
  <p>Even though multiple studies have debunked this myth, the myth persists. A major reason why the myth is still widely popular is that parents have experienced those rushes and hyperactivity happening in real life after their kids ate sugar.
    Even though the parents see it happening, they mistake correlation for causation. Most of the time, when a kid eats lots of sugar, it is on a pretty exciting day. Birthday, Christmas, Halloween, a party. This causes them to be really excited as they are experiencing something out of the ordinary and having lots of fun. So, when the kid is eating sugar, the environment could be affecting them. Although sugar doesn’t make kids hyper, caffeine can. Caffeine is found in chocolates, sodas, sweet teas and coffee-flavoured candies. All of these are common ways for them to eat sugar. Another factor is the placebo effect. Since the parents already believe that the sugar will make them become hyper, they would watch their behaviours more carefully. So, after eating sugar, the child’s normal playful behaviours would seem like hyperactivity. Eliminating the placebo effect during the studies plays a key role in the effectiveness of the study. Finally, confirmation bias keeps the myth alive. After the kid does have a rush and runs around after eating sugar, if you already believed in this myth, you would jump to the conclusion that this is a fact. However, if the kid remains calm after eating sugar, you might think it was a coincidence or not notice it.

  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Sugar has long been blamed for causing kids to be hyper. While it does provide energy. Studies have confirmed that sugar does not play a role in making kids hyperactive. There are many reasons why kids shouldn’t be eating lots of sugar however being hyper isn’t one of them.</p>
