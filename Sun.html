        <h4 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction</h4>
        <p>When we think of the sun, most of us picture a bright yellow ball in the sky. This can be seen in children’s drawings, cartoons, and even photographs. But is the sun actually yellow? The answer might surprise you. While the sun appears yellow to us on Earth, its true color is white. The perception of the sun as yellow is due to the Earth’s atmosphere and the way our eyes interpret light.

    <div class="about-header2">
      <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Origin</h1>
      <p>The idea that the sun is yellow likely stems from our everyday observations. During sunrise and sunset, the sun often appears yellow, orange, or even red due to the scattering of light by the Earth’s atmosphere. This phenomenon, known as Rayleigh scattering, causes shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) to scatter more, leaving longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow). </p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-header3">
    <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Research</h1>
    <p>The sun emits all colours of visible light, which combines to form white light. This is why astronauts in space, who are outside Earth’s atmosphere, describe the sun as white. The Earth’s atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, making the sky appear blue and the sun appear yellow during the day. At sunrise and sunset, when the sun is lower on the horizon, its light passes through more of the atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and leaving the sun looking orange or red.</p>
</div>

<div class="about-header4">
  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Myth Persistance</h1>
  <p> With our eyes seeing the sun as yellow, it is hard to believe that the sun is white. With it not being discussed often and having it engrained in us since we were young. It's borderline common sense making people not question it. With people nor caring to understand this myth, it is no wonder that it is thought to be true.
    </p>

<div class="about-header5">
  <h1 style="color: black;"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Conclusion</h1>
  <p>While the sun appears yellow to us on Earth due to the scattering of light by the atmosphere, its actual color is white. Understanding this can helps us appreciate the complexities of light, color, and the natural world. Learning this can help us understand how light interacts with the world.</p>
